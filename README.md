- An instant messaging system between students and teachers.
- A forum section, where students and professors can post public questions using keywords denoted with hash tags.
- And a feature that allows professors to request feedback from students using surveys.

The website is called Connect Concordia and is available at the following URL: connectconcordia.tk
