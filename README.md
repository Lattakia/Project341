This project is a website designed to facilitate communication between University staff (professors & teaching assistants) and students. It will include:

- An instant messaging system between students and teachers.
- A forum section, where students and professors can post public questions using keywords denoted with hash tags.
- An appointment scheduler.
- And a feature that allows professors to request feedback from students using surveys.

The website is called Connect Concordia. Here is the URL: connectconcordia.tk:3000
