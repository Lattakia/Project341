What the Front-end Needs to do

-	Fix the problem with the chat page. When you resize the page, the chat logs move along on top of the navigation bar. PLEASE FIX THIS!!
-	Forum Page 
-	Please indicate a small note in the search boxes that when you are searching for tags, one space needs to be added between tags when searching for multiple tags. (for both forum-teacher.ejs and forum-stduent.ejs.
